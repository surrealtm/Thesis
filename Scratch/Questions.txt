Questions for the Dan:

* What happened to the Pacing Graph Paper? Cool use case as source...
* Are the few sources alright? Do I need sources for shit like "Triangle Meshes are default"?
* Do I need multiple sources for different pages of the same book? Do I need multiple sources for different direct quotes (on different pages)?
* How does the code work in the submission? Technical Specification?
* How does the Coloquium work? Anmeldung, Ablauf, Zeitraum, Vorbereitung...?
* Do you read some chapters for feedback? Volume Definition, Functional vs. Non-functional Requirements...
